## Install for Windows

### Git for Windows
##### Required.

Install on Windows 10

Download Git for Windows directly from https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest.
* Run the installer program, follow the defaults (recommend other choices in the video, but defaults are ok too)
* Open the Git Bash program, which is a Bash Shell terminal designed specifically for Git on Windows
* Configure Git
  * Git requires your name and email address before any real work can be done. It is best to just configure Git from the start.

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@your-place.com"
```
